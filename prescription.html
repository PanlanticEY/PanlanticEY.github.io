        <h2>Call Summary</h2>

        The patient consulted the doctor due to recent health concerns: a persistent cough, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. The cough had started about two weeks prior, worse at night without specific triggers, accompanied by a fever that subsided after a few days. Though there was no chest pain, the patient felt tightness in the chest and increased fatigue. The doctor suspected a respiratory infection, considering the symptoms and the rural living environment prone to dust exposure and animals. Recommendations included avoiding potential irritants, rest, staying hydrated, and receiving a prescribed treatment to address the infection. The patient agreed to follow the prescription and update the doctor on their progress.

        <h2>Transcript :</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Namaste! How are you feeling today?</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Namaste, Doctor. I've not been well lately. I have a cough, and it feels like I can't breathe properly sometimes.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that. Let's try to understand your symptoms better. Can you tell me when the cough started and if you've noticed anything that triggers it?</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> The cough started a couple of weeks ago. It's worse at night, and I haven't really noticed any specific triggers.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Thank you for sharing that. Have you experienced any other symptoms, like fever or chills?</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Yes, Doctor. I had a fever for a few days, but it went away on its own.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> I see. Apart from the cough and fever, have you noticed any chest pain, wheezing, or any changes in your daily activities?</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> No chest pain, but sometimes it feels a bit tight in my chest. And I get tired more easily than usual.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Got it. Your symptoms could suggest a respiratory infection. Now, about your living environment have there been any recent changes, like exposure to smoke, dust, or any new pets?</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Well, Doctor, I live in a rural area, so there's a lot of dust, and we have some animals around, but nothing has changed recently.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Understood. Considering your symptoms, it's possible you're dealing with a lower respiratory tract infection. However, to narrow it down,In the meantime, try to avoid any potential irritants,take proper rest, stay hydrated.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> I'll be sending you a prescription.</p>
        <p><strong>Patient:</strong> I'll take the prescription and let you know how I feel.</p>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Ok! thank you.</p>
